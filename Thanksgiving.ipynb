    "Converting and describing the income column in `data` was very similar ~identical~ to converting and describing the `Age` data. As such, `int_income`'s summary statistics suffer from the same problems that `int_data` does. Again, the data was originally collected as income ranges, but unlike `Age`, the income columns' ranges were not uniform. For example, the first explicit range, `0 to 9,999`, encompassed a step of 10,000. However, the second income group, `10,000 to 24,999`, was a step of 15,000. Every income group thereafter, with the exception of highest (`200,000 and up`), stepped up by 25,000. This might be why the `std` (standard deviation: `59068.636748`) is not equal to the range as it was for `int_data`.\n",

Based on the quartile information, we can see that most participants were grouped around the `75,000 to 99,000` range. Apply the standard deviation (which should encompass a little over 68% of survey participants if our data fits a bell curve), and most participants should fall within that range, +/- 60,000.\n"
